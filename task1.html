            <h2>What Are Mythological Creatures?</h2>

            <article>
                <p>A mythological creature, also referred to as a legendary creature or mythical creature, is a
                    fictional,
                    supernatural and imaginary animal or hybrid being (meaning it can sometimes be part human). The
                    existence of legendary creatures or mythological creatures referred to in ancient traditional
                    circles
                    has not been proven.</p>
                <p>However, the presence of these creatures has often been described in folklore, legends, fables,
                    poetry,
                    mythology, fairy tales, novels, myths and other varied forms of fiction. Purists are of the opinion
                    that
                    mythical creatures have been described in historical accounts long before history emerged as a
                    branch of
                    science. The beliefs and mindsets associated with mythical beasts are varied and bring to life a
                    plethora of theories about their existence or non-existence.</p>
